    OK, then in the file system there is a "real" (denotated) XML file.

Nice. but there is no link to the current model. It is not a capability or aspect added to the current model.
It is not because an AST has a hierarchical nature that it will automatically be mapped to XML elements!!

One has to define a dedicated custom persistence for each model.
