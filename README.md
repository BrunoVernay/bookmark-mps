Hands on MPS, bookmarks, json ...

Trying to manage Bookmarks with MPS (JetBrains)
- Learning MPS  (Bookmarks may not be the best use-case, but anyway)
- generating various text/json format for various purpose

Basic generation is working.

Big steps will be
- Tag hierarchy support
- import a bookmark list 

Problem is to be able to handle both formats:

```
- a
  - b
    - 1 ...
    - 2 ...
  - c

- a b 1 ...
- a b 2 ...
- a c ...
```
